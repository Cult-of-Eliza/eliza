        "The Ichimoku Cloud is a collection of technical indicators that show support and resistance levels, as well as momentum and trend direction. It does this by taking multiple averages and plotting them on a chart. It also uses these figures to compute a “cloud” that attempts to forecast where the price may find support or resistance in the future.It provides more data points than the standard candlestick chart. the Ichimoku Cloud is composed of five lines or calculations, two of which comprise a cloud where the difference between the two lines is shaded in. The lines include a nine-period average, a 26-period average, an average of those two averages, a 52-period average, and a lagging closing price line. The cloud is a key part of the indicator. When the price is below the cloud, the trend is down. When the price is above the cloud, the trend is up. The above trend signals are strengthened if the cloud is moving in the same direction as the price. For example, during an uptrend, the top of the cloud is moving up, or during a downtrend, the bottom of the cloud is moving down. The following are the five formulas for the lines that comprise the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The highs and lows are the highest and lowest prices seen during the period—for example, the highest and lowest prices seen over the last nine days in the case of the conversion line. if you want to calculate it by hand, here are the steps: Calculate the Conversion Line and the Base Line. Calculate Leading Span A based on the prior calculations. Once calculated, this data point is plotted 26 periods into the future. Calculate Leading Span B. Plot this data point 26 periods into the future. For the Lagging Span, plot the closing price 26 periods into the past on the chart. The difference between Leading Span A and Leading Span B is colored in to create the cloud. When Leading Span A is above Leading Span B, color the cloud green. When Leading Span A is below Leading Span B, color the cloud red. The above steps will create one data point. To create the lines, as each period comes to an end, go through the steps again to create new data points for that period. Connect the data points to each other to create the lines and cloud appearance. The technical indicator shows relevant information at a glance by using averages. The overall trend is up when the price is above the cloud, down when the price is below the cloud, and trendless or transitioning when the price is in the cloud. When Leading Span A is rising and above Leading Span B, this helps to confirm the uptrend and the space between the lines is typically colored green. When Leading Span A is falling and below Leading Span B, this helps confirm the downtrend. The space between the lines is typically colored red in this case. Traders will often use the Ichimoku Cloud as an area of support and resistance depending on the relative location of the price. The cloud provides support/resistance levels that can be projected into the future. This sets the Ichimoku Cloud apart from many other technical indicators that only provide support and resistance levels for the current date and time. during a very strong downtrend, the price may push into the cloud or slightly above it, temporarily, before falling again. Only focusing on the indicator would mean missing the bigger picture that the price was under strong longer-term selling pressure. Crossovers are another way that the indicator can be used. Watch for the conversion line to move above the base line, especially when the price is above the cloud. This can be a powerful buy signal. One option is to hold the trade until the conversion line drops back below the base line. Any of the other lines could be used as exit points as well. Senkou Span A takes the average of the Tenkan Sen and the Kijun Sen plotted 26 periods ahead of the current price action. Senkou Span B averages the highest high and the lowest low taken over the past 52 time periods and then plotted 26 periods ahead. The Chikou Span is meant to measure market sentiment, using the most recent closing price and plotted 26 periods behind the price action. In order to create a cloud to show where prices may find future resistance or support, the Ichimoku Cloud plots multiple averages on a chart. This shows not only support and resistance but also trend direction and momentum, all of which appear as a group of technical indicators. While there are some limitations to the Ichimoku Cloud, it is neither better nor worse than existing technical indicators such as moving averages. It simply represents information in a different way.",
        "Advanced Embedding Research explores several techniques to enhance the quality and effectiveness of embeddings. 1. Hybrid Similarity Measures address the limitations of cosine similarity by combining it with other metrics like Euclidean distance or dot product. This approach captures both the direction (angle) and magnitude (scale) of vectors, leading to more accurate similarity assessments. Implementations include re-ranking cosine similarity results using Euclidean distance or a weighted combination of both metrics. While computationally more intensive, this method balances semantic meaning with spatial proximity. 2. Regularization techniques, such as contrastive loss and batch hard triplet loss, prevent embedding collapse, ensuring that similar items are close but not too close and dissimilar items are far apart. Contrastive loss uses a margin-based loss function to maintain adequate spacing between embeddings. These techniques require retraining the embedding model but improve cluster separability. 3. Subspace Partitioning divides the embedding space into subspaces dedicated to different data types or concepts, such as using different dimensions for semantic meaning and metadata. This enhances separability and interpretability for specialized queries but reduces overall flexibility. 4. Dimensionality Reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP compress embeddings to improve computational efficiency and reduce sparsity. PCA reduces the number of dimensions while preserving relationships, while t-SNE and UMAP are useful for visualization and clustering in lower-dimensional space. However, this carries the risk of losing subtle semantic relationships. 5. Weighted Embedding Regions design the embedding space to allocate specific regions for dense clusters and sparse regions for general-purpose data. This is achieved through custom training objectives and encoding metadata into embedding values. While highly customizable, it requires significant effort during training. In Weaviate, region-specific metadata can be used to prioritize specific clusters during queries. These techniques can be combined for optimal results, for example, using regularization during training, subspace partitioning for data separation, hybrid similarity measures for queries, and storing compressed embeddings. Generating Training Data involves various strategies. 1. Pretrained models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or BERT provide a strong baseline, offering general-purpose knowledge adaptable to specific domains. This involves extracting and refining pretrained embeddings or fine-tuning the models using techniques like LoRA. This reduces the need for large initial datasets. 2. Synthetic data generation creates artificial data using prompt-based generation with models like GPT-4, VAEs, or data augmentation techniques like paraphrasing or synonym swapping. This is useful for domain-specific training. 3. Self-supervised training uses unlabeled data with techniques like contrastive learning (e.g., masked language modeling, Siamese networks) or autoencoders to extract embeddings. 4. Domain-specific simulation uses rule-based generators or expert systems to create realistic examples based on domain knowledge. 5. Transfer learning trains embeddings on related public datasets before applying them to specific use cases. 6. Zero-shot and few-shot learning leverage large pretrained models to generalize from minimal or no training data. 7. Semi-synthetic data combines real and synthetic data for bootstrapping training. 8. Active learning iteratively expands labeled data by selecting uncertain examples for labeling. 9. Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) optimizes embeddings based on user feedback on retrieval results. The choice of method depends on data availability: pretrained models and synthetic data for zero data, self-supervised or semi-synthetic for unstructured data, and active learning and RLHF with user access.",
